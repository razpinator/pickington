# Privacy Policy for Pickington

**Effective Date:** February 22, 2026

## Introduction

Pickington ("we", "us", or "our") is a Chrome Extension designed to help developers and designers inspect and extract HTML and CSS information from web pages. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or browsing history to external servers.**

Pickington operates strictly locally on your device. The data it processes—such as the HTML structure, CSS styles, and DOM hierarchy of the pages you inspect—is used solely for the purpose of displaying that information to you and copying it to your clipboard at your request.

### Local Storage

Pickington uses the Chrome Storage API (`chrome.storage`) to save your user preferences locally within your browser. This includes:

*   **Extraction Preferences:** Whether you have chosen to include "Parent Structure" or "Computed CSS" in your extractions.

This data is stored on your device and is not shared with us or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

Pickington does not integrate with any third-party analytics, tracking tools, or advertising networks.

## Permissions

To function correctly, Pickington requires the following permissions:

*   **`activeTab`**: To access the content of the current tab when you activate the extension.
*   **`scripting`**: To inject the code required to pick and inspect elements on the page.
*   **`storage`**: To save your extension preferences (as mentioned above).

These permissions are used exclusively to provide the extension's core functionality.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
